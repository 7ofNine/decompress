                    IBM PC Decompression Software
                    -----------------------------

IBM PC software modules are supplied in the PC subdirectory as:

            1. Stand-alone application PCDCOMP
            2. C-language source code for program VDCOMP
            3. C-language source code for DECOMP subroutines
            4. C-language source code for program DETEST
            5. FORTRAN-language source code for subroutine BTEST
            6. FORTRAN-language source code for DECOMP subroutines
            7. FORTRAN-language source code for program DETEST
            8. FORTRAN-language source code for program PCDRIV
            9. FORTRAN-language source code for program IMGINDEX

These modules are described in detail in the following sections.

Stand-alone Executable PCDCOMP
------------------------------
The program PCDCOMP creates decompressed image files and is supplied as
an executable in the PCDCOMP.EXE file.  The output files will contain
fixed-length records in one of four formats (see below).  The image
histogram and all engineering parameters are discarded when writing
the FITS, VICAR and unlabelled formats.

The output formats supported all have fixed-length records:

     FORMAT                           RESULTING FILE
     --------------------------------------------------
     SFDU/PDS                         836-byte records
     FITS                             2880-byte records
     VICAR                            800-byte records
     unlabelled raster                800-byte records


C-language Program VDCOMP
-------------------------
The program VDCOMP is a C-language image decompression program that
includes all routines necessary to produce an executable version of
the program.  It is supplied as source code in the VDCOMP.C file.
VDCOMP prompts the user for a input file name, output file format
choice, and output file name.  The output file formats supported by
VDCOMP are identical to those of PCDCOMP above.

The following commands should be used to link subroutines and produce
an executable file, using Microsoft C Version 5.x.

      cl /c VDCOMP.c
      link  VDCOMP/stack:10000;

 Use the following command to run the program:

      VDCOMP [infile] [outfile] [output format]

         infile        - name of compressed image file.
         outfile       - name of uncompressed output file.
         output format - selected from the following list:

            1  SFDU/PDS format [DEFAULT].
            2  FITS format.
            3  VICAR format.
            4  Unlabelled binary array.


C-language DECOMP Subroutines
-----------------------------
For those who want to write their own C-language programs, decompression
subroutines are provided in the DECOMP.C file.  This file contains the
subroutines:

                decmpinit     decompress
                dcmprs        huff_tree      sort_freq

See the example C-language program below for subroutine usage.


C-language Program DETEST
-------------------------
DETEST is a main program, located in the DETEST.C file, which tests the
performance of the decompression software.  Anyone adapting the software
to their particular hardware and operating system environment will need
this program for testing the software.


FORTRAN-language Program DETEST
-------------------------------
DETEST.FOR is the FORTRAN version of the above program.


FORTRAN-language DECOMP Subroutines
----------------------------------
The FORTRAN versions of the decompression subroutines reside in the
DECOMP.FOR file. This file contains the subroutines:

               DECMPINIT      DECOMPRESS
               DCMPRS         HUFF_TREE      SORT_FREQ

See the example FORTRAN program below for subroutine usage.


FORTRAN-language Subroutine BTEST
---------------------------------
BTEST.FOR contains a FORTRAN version of the VAX/VMS BTEST intrinsic
function. Use this routine only if you are not running under the
VAX/VMS environment.


FORTRAN-language Program PCDRIV
-------------------------------
PCDRIV.FOR is a program to decompress image files and write them
out to a PDS-formatted file.  The program needs to be compiled,
then linked with the DECOMP object file to produce an executable file.

 Using Microsoft FORTRAN Version 4.1:

    fl pcdriv.for decomp.for


FORTRAN-language Program IMGINDEX
--------------------------------
IMGINDEX.FOR will read and display the contents of the Image Index Table
(IMGINDEX.TAB).  The Image Index Table must be in the same directory as
the executable for the program to operate properly.  The FILE='IMGINDEX.TAB'
statement in the OPEN call can be edited to reflect the location of the
table (for example, on an IBM PC it might be specified as
FILE='L:\INDEX\IMGINDEX.TAB').


Example C-language Program
--------------------------

This example program demonstrates the use of the decompression
subroutines.
